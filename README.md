# GPAcalc
This is a basic GPA calculator using R. All the default values are from my classes and grades at MSU Denver. Gives the overall GPA based on the coressponding grades and credits.
Additionally it can calculate the specific GPA for common courses: for instance it can calcuate your GPA for all Math courses (MTH). Written by Jonothan Meyer in Spring 2021.
